🚀 Web Development & Logic Engineering Journey
Welcome to my professional learning repository. My name is Akib, and I am a passionate developer focused on understanding the "Deep Logic" of the web. I don't just write code; I engineer solutions by understanding how the world (and AI) works.

🧠 My Learning Philosophy: "Deep over Shallow"
I believe in mastering the fundamentals before moving to advanced frameworks. My goal is to build a rock-solid foundation in Web Technologies before transitioning into React, AI, and Machine Learning.
