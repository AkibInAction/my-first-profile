# My First Coding Step 🚀

Hi! I am Akib. This is my first code ever. I started by learning the 'Why'—how hardware works, how binary turns into text, and how monitors show colors.

### My Philosophy 💡
Don't just watch long YouTube videos. Learn how the hardware 'thinks' and you will start making your own logic. 

### Specs & Goals 🎯
* **PC:** i5-12400F (My learning machine)
* **Inspiration:** Nikola Tesla & Elon Musk
* **Target:** Financial independence by the end of 2026.
