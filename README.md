# My Web Development Journey day-7🚀

I am currently building my foundation in Web Development before transitioning into AI/ML. This repository serves as a tracker for my daily progress, concepts I've mastered, and the "deep dives" I perform every day.

## 🛠 Currently Mastering
- **HTML5:** Semantic structures and accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Box model, Flexbox, and the art of responsive design.
- **UI/UX:** Understanding visual hierarchy and user-centric layouts.

## 🧠 Why I'm doing this
I believe in understanding how the world works, which means understanding how the web works first. I don't just want to code; I want to understand the "why" behind the "how."

## 📅 Roadmap
- [x] Setting up my Environment (Git/GitHub)
- [/] Mastering CSS Layouts (In Progress)
- [ ] JavaScript Logic & DOM
- [ ] UI/UX Case Studies
- [ ] Transition to AI/ML (After mastering the Web)
