# Web Development Learning - Day 5

## Today's Progress: Code Organization & Project Structure
Today, I moved from writing everything in one file to a professional **File Separation** method. I organized my project into three distinct layers to understand how modern websites are built.

### What I Implemented:
* **HTML (Structure):** Created `work.html` to handle the skeleton of the page.
* **CSS (Design):** Created an external `style.css` for a dark-themed UI (Black background with Aqua text).
* **JavaScript (Logic):** Created `script.js` to handle interactivity.

### Key Learnings:
* **Linking External Files:** Learned how to use `<link>` for CSS and `<script src="">` for JS.
* **Browser DevTools:** Mastered the **Inspect Element** tool to debug styles and view the "Styles" tab in real-time.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Understood that Frontend is not just one file, but a combination of structure, style, and behavior.
